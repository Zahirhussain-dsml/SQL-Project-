Conclusion

The analysis of customer churn in the e-commerce sector is essential for businesses aiming to improve retention rates and enhance overall customer satisfaction. Throughout this project, we have explored a rich dataset containing various attributes that influence customer behavior and decision-making. By systematically processing and analyzing this data, we were able to uncover valuable insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn.

Key Findings

1. **Churn vs. Active Customers**: Our exploration highlighted the distribution of churned and active customers, providing a clearer understanding of the customer base and the scope of potential churn issues that need addressing.

2. **Tenure and Satisfaction**: We found a strong correlation between customer tenure and churn, indicating that longer-tenured customers tend to exhibit higher loyalty. Additionally, satisfaction scores significantly influenced churn behavior, reinforcing the need for businesses to prioritize customer satisfaction initiatives.

3. **Impact of Complaints**: The analysis revealed that customers who complained were more likely to churn. This finding underscores the importance of not only addressing complaints swiftly but also proactively improving the overall customer experience to reduce the likelihood of churn.

4. **Spending Patterns**: By investigating spending behaviors, we determined spending patterns related to churn, including the total cashback earned by churned customers. This insight can guide marketing promotions and retention strategies aimed at enhancing customer engagement.

5. **Demographic Insights**: Gender and marital status analyses provided nuanced understanding of customer preferences and behaviors, which can inform targeted marketing campaigns.

6. **Payment Preferences and Order Categories**: The preferred payment modes and order categories exemplified variations between active and churned customers, suggesting that aligning offerings with customer preferences can help reduce attrition.

7. **Geographic Insights**: Identifying the city tiers or regions with the highest churn rates can help businesses focus their retention efforts where they are most needed.
